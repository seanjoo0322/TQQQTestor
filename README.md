# TQQQTestor
I tried to determine whether I can earn profit buy purchasing sqqq/tqqq if either tqqq/sqqq increases for two/three/four consecutive days

Conclusion: 
Was a fun experiment but there wasn't siginificant results that supported this hypothesis. 

Fun thing founded:
It kinda works from tqqq/sqqq from 1 year ago till now or 5 years ago till now but not ALL TIME.
